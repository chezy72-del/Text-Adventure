I have created a story maker, where the user gets to influence the outcome of the story by a series of options throughout story. 
It is an open ended project where I get to use my own creativity to write the story. The only instructions are that it has to contain loops and conditionals and it has to have at least 3 possible outcomes. 

In this project I am using C++ and have included user input, loops and conditionals in order to make every story unique.
The story also has a total of 6 possible outcomes, and thats not even including the uniqueness of each story using the initial user inputs. 

I throughly enjoyed doing this project, I enjoyed the creativity of it and I even enjoyed that I struggled with the for loop which required me to really think about my conditions in order for it to work. 
When I thought I had finished with the project, I got someone to run through the story and they answered y instead of 1. This made me reassess my code and then add in the while loop to check for valid responses before continuing. 

This project has been a big learning curve in my C++ journey, I am proud of the progress I have made since starting learning last month and I am looking forward to continuing expanding my knowledge.
